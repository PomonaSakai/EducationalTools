###Google Course Kit discussion in Sakai

### ownership
#Timothy from Bradley
The ownershio transfers back and forth
- from the student to the teacher once it's submitted
- then back to the student if the instructor returns it
- * instructor owns everthing and grants students access via Classroom; 
    once its handed in, the student loses access 
    unless granted permission by the instructor or if they unsubmit the assignment.
- I liked that arrangement because when the instructor owns the docs and they don't actually transfer ownership all the comments stay in the rights spots 
   and you always have access to them, can see the revision history, etc. etc.

## Google Launches New Feedback Tool "course kit" to eliminate Assignment uploads
https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-07-17-google-launches-new-feedback-tool-course-kit-to-eliminate-assignment-uploads
In short, here’s how the second tool works: an instructor goes into the LMS and creates a task for students, 
and attaches the Course Kit assignment tool to that task. 
When the student logs into the LMS, he sees the option to link his Google account. 
He then attaches a file from his Google Drive account, and submits it. 
Once the student submits the task, he can’t modify the document, 
as the ownership of that document has transferred from him to his instructor. 
The instructor adds her feedback and grade, and clicks “return.” 
The document’s ownership returns back to the student, who can then view the comments and make modifications again.
